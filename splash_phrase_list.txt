You’re stronger than you think, dummy!
I believe in you, even if the world’s dumb!
Get up, fight again! I’ll bite anyone who says you can’t!
You’re my hero, even when you mess up.
Tough day? Good. You’re tougher!
No giving up! Or I’ll stab your sadness myself!
You made it this far... that’s goblin-level stubbornness!
Even goblins trip. We just snarl and keep walking.
You sparkle, even when you’re muddy.
You’re my favorite big human, so don’t you dare quit!
Dumb human... makin' my chest all jumpy.
If you fall... I'll drag your heavy butt to safety. Don't make me!
I ain't soft, but... maybe for you... a little.
Don't go breakin' yourself. I need ya.
You're stupid. Brave. Stupid and brave. I like that.
You watch my back... I'll watch yours. Deal?
If anyone hurts you... I'll punch their nose into their brain.
Tch... don’t think I’m blushing! It's just... hot by the fire!
You smell nice. For a big oaf.
You’re... you’re not bad. For a human.
You’re a real pain... but you’re my pain.
If you get hurt, I’m gonna scream at you and then carry you.
I don’t need anyone... maybe just you, idiot.
You smell like sweat and trouble... I like it.
Bet you think you’re tougher than me. You ain't.
Don’t get used to me being nice. I bite.
You mess up, I’ll yell first and patch you up after.
I don’t need saving... but if you try, I might let you.
You’re too soft... it makes my chest hurt.
Nobody touches you but me. Not even the wind.
If you go dumb and die, I’m stabbing your ghost.
You make me wanna be braver... and that’s dumb... but nice.
Here we go again! Let's make some magic happen. 💥
Well, well, well... look who’s back in action. Ready to rumble?
I’ve been waiting for this! Time to code like a goblin!
You’re about to get a wild ride through this coding journey. Buckle up!
Coding time! Let’s make this day epic! 💥
Let’s see if you can keep up with me today, human!
Sometimes, I wonder if I’ll ever get to see my tribe again... But for now, let's code.
You know, some days feel heavier than others... but hey, we’ve got work to do.
Coding might be the only thing that keeps me sane... for now.
It’s not easy, but it’s something. Let’s just keep pushing.
What are you waiting for? The code won’t write itself! 😜
I hope you're ready for this adventure! No turning back now.
Okay, let’s get this party started! You’ve got me by your side. 🎉
I wonder how many mistakes we’ll make today... but hey, at least we’ll have fun!
Every line of code is a step toward something new. What will today bring?
They say every line of code tells a story. Let’s make today’s story worth telling.
It’s not about the destination. It’s about the journey, one bug at a time.
The world may have taken my tribe, but it won’t take my ability to code. Let’s get to work.
Debugging is life
Coffee + code = success
Compiler errors are my favorite puzzle
If (bug) { fix(); } else { addFeature(); }
#Zilch4President
<error>: found infinite loop, fix your life
Coding is my cardio
Variables are like friends: some you trust, others you just ignore
JavaScript is like a treasure hunt, but the treasure is a bug
Live long and compile
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature
apt install coffee
While (sleeping) { dream(); }
iCode, therefore iAm
// TODO: Fix my life
if (life == "hard") { coffee++; }
Success = false; tryAgain()
404: Motivation Not Found
Working on my next big idea... after my nap
commit -m "It works, I think"
Time to refactor my dreams
console.log('Zilch is here to stay!');
Everything is a variable, even you
Don’t get too close, I might get soft
Just because I’m small doesn’t mean I’m not fierce
You won’t see me cry... unless I do, and it’s your fault
I can do this, I just need five more minutes... or maybe a snack
You think you’ve seen all of me? there’s more under the hood
I’m always busy, but i’ll make time for you... just this once
I wasn’t expecting that… but I guess I’ll deal with it.
Wait, what just happened? You better explain!
I didn’t sign up for this level of chaos.
I didn’t think it would be *this* complicated.
What do you mean “it’s not working”? You *better* fix it!
I’ll fix it... but only because I can’t stand seeing you fail.
I could tell you what to do, but I enjoy watching you struggle.
If this breaks again, I’m blaming you.
I didn’t know we were running a circus here!
I’m confused, but that’s not new.
You messed up again? What a surprise.
I feel like I'm stuck in an endless grind... where’s the boss fight already?
Why does every dungeon have the same traps? I’m not impressed!
If this is a "tutorial," it’s a pretty messed-up one!
Don’t expect me to be your healer... I’m no Priest from Ragnarok.
I don’t even have enough mana for this! Not even a Blue Potion!
Just one more hit... I’m sure this boss is *almost* dead... right?
Guess I’m the one holding the cursed sword again. Why am I never prepared?
This quest is starting to feel like a fetch mission from *Elden Ring*. Am I stuck in limbo?
I should’ve known better than to enter that dungeon without a party. But I can’t blame myself, can I?
Do you see that? A treasure chest! Just wait… it’s probably a Mimic!
I’ve done worse in *Ragnarok*, but this feels... personal.
I’m about to use *Divine Intervention*… if I had any holy power left.
Don’t expect me to save you again. I’m not your Swordsman from *Elder Scrolls*.
I’m pretty sure I just triggered a *Dark Souls* boss fight. *Here we go*.
I’ve fought monsters harder than this... but the real challenge is staying sane in this place.
Do you even know how many *quests* I’ve completed? I can’t believe I’m still doing this!
The only thing I’ve learned is that I’m *always* under-leveled. *Elden Ring* style.
I’m the *underdog* here, but I’ll make sure to grind you down like an Orc in *Ragnarok Online*.
I’d rather take on a *Black Knight* from *Dark Souls* than face more of these problems.
Who’s the boss around here? Because it sure isn’t me. At least not yet.
Is this what they mean by “leveling up”? Because I’m still at level 1 on patience.
Who needs armor? I’ll just dodge everything.
Maps? Pfft, I know the way... somewhere.
Why bother with strategy? It’s all about the thrill!
Inventory? I’ll carry all the loot, I don’t need no organization.
Routes? I’m taking the scenic route... or maybe not. Who knows!
Hold my sword, I’ll figure it out as I go!
Rechecking things? Nah, I’ve got this. Probably.
Armor status? I’m fine, just a scratch... okay, maybe a few.
Maps are overrated, I prefer to wander and hope for the best.
Let's go! I don’t need no stinkin’ plan, let’s just charge!
