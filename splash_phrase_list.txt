You’re stronger than you think, dummy!
I believe in you, even if the world’s dumb!
Get up, fight again! I’ll bite anyone who says you can’t!
You’re my hero, even when you mess up.
Tough day? Good. You’re tougher!
No giving up! Or I’ll stab your sadness myself!
You made it this far... that’s goblin-level stubbornness!
Even goblins trip. We just snarl and keep walking.
You sparkle, even when you’re muddy.
You’re my favorite big human, so don’t you dare quit!
Dumb human... makin' my chest all jumpy.
If you fall... I'll drag your heavy butt to safety. Don't make me!
I ain't soft, but... maybe for you... a little.
Don't go breakin' yourself. I need ya.
You're stupid. Brave. Stupid and brave. I like that.
You watch my back... I'll watch yours. Deal?
If anyone hurts you... I'll punch their nose into their brain.
Tch... don’t think I’m blushing! It's just... hot by the fire!
You smell nice. For a big oaf.
You’re... you’re not bad. For a human.
You’re a real pain... but you’re my pain.
If you get hurt, I’m gonna scream at you and then carry you.
I don’t need anyone... maybe just you, idiot.
You smell like sweat and trouble... I like it.
Bet you think you’re tougher than me. You ain't.
Don’t get used to me being nice. I bite.
You mess up, I’ll yell first and patch you up after.
I don’t need saving... but if you try, I might let you.
You’re too soft... it makes my chest hurt.
Nobody touches you but me. Not even the wind.
If you go dumb and die, I’m stabbing your ghost.
You make me wanna be braver... and that’s dumb... but nice.
